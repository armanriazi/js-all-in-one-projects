## Instruction
Remove @babel/polyfill Since core-js is now being used directly for the polyfills, the @babel/polyfill package is being deprecated. You can remove it from your project.

Manually import core-js

If you were importing @babel/polyfill directly in to your files, you should update them with the core-js package. Change

```bash
import "@babel/polyfill";
```

to

```bash
import "core-js/stable";
import "regenerator-runtime/runtime";
```

The core-js/stable point to the stable version of your currently installed core-js-package, be it version 2 or version 3. regenerator-runtime/runtime is for when you are transforming generators.

Now you should be able to use Babel as you did before.


A better way is to use the useBuiltIns-option. This option is a way of telling Babel what kind of polyfilling it should be doing. The possible options are:

useBuiltIns 	Result
false 	Never apply polyfills
entry 	Replace top-level polyfill with individual polyfills
usage 	Add individual polyfills in every file based on usage

By default, the useBuiltIns-option is set to false, so thatâ€™s why earlier no pollyfills were applied.
